# Disaster Tweets
## by Thu Pham


## Dataset

>  Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
>  In this project, I will use RNN to predict which tweet is disaster related.


## Important Findings

- The 1st model has 7 layers, utilizing unidirectional LSTM. The training accuracy is 78.80%. The validation accuracy is 79.71%. The test accuracy is 79.28%.
- The 2nd model has 7 layers, utilizing bidirectional LSTM. The training accuracy is 82.68%. The validation accuracy is 80.24%. The test accuracy is 80.63%.
